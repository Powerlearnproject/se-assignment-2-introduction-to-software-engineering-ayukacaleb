# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
This is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Software engineering focuses on the systematic design, development, testing and project management while traditional programming focuses on writing of code to solve a certain problem without structured processes and order or considerations.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. Requirements analysis - Focuses on gathering and analyzing requirements from stakeholders.
2. Design - Develops architecture, system specifications, and detailed design plans.
3. Implementation - Coding and development of the software system based on the design.
4. Testing - Validates the software against requirements and identifies defects.
5. Deployment - Releases the software to users or production environment.
6. Maintenance - Involves ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile has an incremental and iterative approach which focuses on flexiblity, collaboration and responding to change while waterfall methodology has a sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g requirent analysis, design,maintenance) flowing downwards just like a waterfall

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
Agile is iterative, flexible and customer centric, ideal with projects with changing requirements and frequent feedback.Waterfall is sequential and hence it is good for stable projects with unchanging requirements.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting and maintaining software requirements.Key steps are elicitation, analysis, specification, validation, and management. It ensures stakeholder needs are met, guiding development and reducing risks.
Importance:Ensures clarity, reduces risks, and aligns development with user needs, improving quality.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
Modularuty is the concept of dividing code into small units caleed modules.Modularity divides software into self-contained units with specific functionalities and clear interfaces, improving maintainability by isolating changes and enhancing reusability. It boosts scalability by allowing parallel development and load distribution.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
1. Unit testing - Tests individual components or functions of the software.
2. Integration testing - Tests the interaction between integrated units or modules.
3. System testing - Tests the complete and integrated software system.
4. Acceptance testing - Tests the system's compliance with business requirements.
Testing is crucial to ensure software functionality, reliability, and performance. It identifies defects early, reducing costs and time associated with fixing issues later in the development cycle.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
Version Control Systems are tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Version Control System are important because they make collaboration possible, history tracking, merging,branching and even backup/recovery.
examples of cersion control systems include:
1. Git:
Features: Distributed VCS, branching and merging support, lightweight and fast, offline capabilities, extensive community support.
2. Subversion
Features: Centralized VCS, directory versioning, atomic commits, branching and tagging, integrated authentication and authorization.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
The software project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects. Key responsibilities include defining project scope, allocating resources, managing timelines, and ensuring quality. Challenges include balancing competing priorities, managing changing requirements, mitigating risks, and fostering collaboration among team members.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
Software maintenance refers to the process of modifying and updating a software system after it has been deployed. It includes activities aimed at preserving and enhancing the software's functionality, performance, and usability over its operational lifetime. Software maintenance is important because it preserves reliability, adapts to change, sustains value, enhances satisfaction, and reduces total cost.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ethical issues for software engineers include data privacy, algorithmic bias, and intellectual property theft. They can ensure ethical standards by adhering to professional codes of conduct, transparently communicating risks, prioritizing user welfare, and seeking ethical guidance when faced with ethical dilemmas. Regular ethics training and accountability mechanisms also promote ethical behavior.
